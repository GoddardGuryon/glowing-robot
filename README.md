# glowing-robot
My own implementation of an RSA-based digital signature generator and SHA512 hashing algorithm
 - The file `glowing_signature.py` contains all codes required for working with RSA-based digital signatures (use the function `demo_everything()` to see how it works).
 - The file `glowing_hash.py` contains all codes required to generate a SHA512 hash of any string you provide (use the function `demo_everything()` to see how it works).
 
 _PS:_ DO NOT USE THESE CODES FOR ANY WORK ANYWHERE! I WROTE THESE CODES JUST TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK. THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO BE RELIABLE OR EVEN FUNCTIONAL!
